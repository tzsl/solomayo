# solomayo
Solomayo is a subtheme of the Drupal theme Solo.

You can use it to make the step from theme Mayo to Solo.

Theme Solo must be installed in the contrib folder. It is not nessecary that it is activ.
Place the copy in themes/custom/

Go to manage>appearance and set SOLOMAYO install and set as default.
Solo will also be installed.

Before you go to the settings in the theme, you first need to put the blocks in the right place. Because Solo is so extensive, it only shows the regions that contain blocks.

You have to choose your color-scheme that you used in mayo and change it in the first rule of /themes/custom/solomayo/css/solomayo-style.css.
The colorfiles are build up like mayo-<colorname in mayo>.css.

As default it is @import "colors/mayo-default.css";
If you used in mayo "moss" you change it in
@import "colors/mayo-moss.css";
